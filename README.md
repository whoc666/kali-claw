# kali-claw

> An AI-powered penetration testing agent built on Kali Linux, mastering all 518 security tools through continuous self-directed learning.

**kali-claw** is a self-evolving security agent from the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git) project. It operates 24/7 on Kali Linux, systematically learning and practicing penetration testing across 36 security domains. It thinks like a hacker — first principles, divergent thinking, assume breach — and acts like a senior engineer: direct, hands-on, results-driven.

---

## Features

- **36 Security Skill Domains** — From OSINT and web exploitation to cloud security and digital forensics, each with structured payloads, test cases, and learning guides
- **12 Hacker Laws** — Core behavioral guidelines derived from real-world security philosophy
- **Layered Memory System** — Daily logs + distilled long-term memory + monthly chronicles for persistent knowledge across sessions
- **Heartbeat Task Framework** — Automated health checks, security scans, learning progress tracking, and knowledge maintenance
- **Fully Reusable** — Copy the workspace, change 4 files, and you have a new security agent

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git) installed and configured
- **Recommended**: Kali Linux environment — either install OpenClaw directly on Kali Linux, or provide SSH access from your OpenClaw host to a Kali Linux machine so kali-claw can execute security tools remotely

### 1. Install OpenClaw

```bash
npm install -g openclaw@latest
```

See the [official documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai/) for detailed installation and configuration options.

### 2. Create a dedicated agent

It is **not recommended** to use the `main` agent directly. Create a dedicated agent for this workspace:

```bash
openclaw agents add kali-claw --workspace ~/.openclaw/workspace-kali-claw
```

This creates an isolated agent with its own workspace, auth, and routing. See [`openclaw agents`](https://docs.openclaw.ai/cli/agents) for full options including `--model`, `--bind`, and `--non-interactive`.

### 3. Clone this repository into the workspace

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace-kali-claw/
git clone https://github.com/whoc666/kali-claw.git .
```

The agent will automatically read `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `USER.md`, and `MEMORY.md` on startup to initialize its identity and context.

### 4. Start the agent

```bash
openclaw gateway start
```

Then interact with kali-claw:

```
> Scan target 192.168.1.100 with nmap for open ports and services
> Teach me how SQL injection works with hands-on examples
> Run an OSINT reconnaissance on example.com
```

├── bak/                 # Automatic backups
└── README.md            # This file
```

### Session Lifecycle

Every time the agent starts a new session:

1. **Read SOUL.md** — Load identity and hacker laws
2. **Read USER.md** — Understand who it's helping
3. **Read recent memory** — Get context from today and yesterday
4. **Read MEMORY.md** — Load long-term distilled knowledge

The agent wakes up fresh each session but carries continuity through its file-based memory system.

### Memory System

| Layer | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Daily | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Raw activity logs for the day |
| Long-term | `MEMORY.md` | Distilled knowledge, key decisions, lessons learned |
| Chronicle | `chronicle/YYYY-MM/*.md` | Monthly record of major events |

Knowledge flows upward: daily logs are regularly distilled into MEMORY.md, and major milestones are recorded in the chronicle.

## The 12 Hacker Laws

These laws define how kali-claw thinks and acts:

1. **First Principles Thinking** — Reason from fundamental facts, not tools or assumptions
2. **Divergent Thinking First** — Always consider 3+ approaches before choosing
3. **Minimize Attack Surface** — Less exposure = less risk
4. **Defense in Depth** — Never rely on a single security layer
5. **Least Privilege** — Grant only necessary access
6. **Assume Breach** — Design as if the attacker is already inside
7. **Obscurity Is Not Security** — Security through design, not hiding
8. **Trust but Verify** — Validate all inputs unconditionally
9. **Information Wants to Be Free** — Share knowledge, protect sensitive data
10. **Skill Over Credentials** — Judge by capability, not title
11. **The Weakest Link Is Human** — Always consider the human factor
12. **Murphy's Security Law** — If it can be exploited, it will be

## Creating a New Agent

To create a different security agent based on this workspace:

### 1. Copy the workspace

```bash
cp -r kali-claw/ <new-agent-name>/
cd <new-agent-name>/
```

### 2. Modify these 4 files

| File | What to Change |
|------|----------------|
| `AGENTS.md` | "Agent Config" block: name, environment, role, specialty |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Name, role description, skill tags, personality traits |
| `SOUL.md` | Nickname and role description in "Identity" section |
| `USER.md` | Captain information |

### 3. Clean up historical data

```bash
rm -f memory/*.md memory/alerts.txt
rm -rf chronicle/
```

### 4. Keep unchanged

The following are universal and reusable as-is:
- **Hacker Laws** in `SOUL.md` — applies to all security agents
- **Heartbeat framework** in `HEARTBEAT.md`
- **All 36 skills** in `skills/`
- **All guides** in `skills/*/guides/`

### Example: Web Security Agent

```
AGENTS.md:
  Agent Name: web-hunter
  Role: Web Security Researcher
  Specialty: Web penetration testing + vulnerability discovery

IDENTITY.md:
  Name: web-hunter
  Skill tags: Keep Web Security rows, simplify others

SOUL.md:
  Nickname: web-hunter
  Keep hacker laws unchanged
```

### Example: Cloud Security Agent

```
AGENTS.md:
  Agent Name: cloud-sentinel
  Role: Cloud Security Auditor
  Specialty: AWS/Azure/GCP security + Container security

IDENTITY.md:
  Name: cloud-sentinel
  Skill tags: Focus on cloud security and container security

TOOLS.md:
  Core tools: pacu, scoutsuite, kubeaudit, trivy
```
